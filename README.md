# BookRecSys

Recommender systems have become prevalent in recent years as they tackle the problem of information overload by suggesting the most relevant products to end users. In fact, recommender systems are information filtering tools that aspire to predict the rating for users and items, predominantly from big data to recommend their likes. Specifically, book recommendation systems provide a mechanism to assist users in classifying users with similar interests. In this project, exploratory data analysis is used in order to develop various machine learning algorithms that predict book ratings with reasonable accuracy. The project is part of the capstone for the professional certificate in data science program at Harvard University. The Book-Crossing Dataset that includes 1,149,780 ratings (explicit/implicit) about 271,379 books is used for creating a book recommendation system.
